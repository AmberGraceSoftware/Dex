# Combining Components

:::warning
Tutorials are still in progress, and will be released section-by-section
:::

## Section Outline:
- Introducing `virtualInstance:Combine(virtualInstance)`, use cases, how it
opens the door for re-useable Components and composition over inheritance
- Making an input wrapper that uses `:Combine()`
- Making a view router using `:Combine()` to only mount a component while it
is currently visible
- Things to avoid, best practices (i.e. Pure functions)
