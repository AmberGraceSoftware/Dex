# Adding Gamepad Support

:::warning
Tutorials are still in progress, and will be released section-by-section
:::

## Section Outline:
- Holy cow we need to add first-class support for Roblox's gamepad methods...
- Dex.GamepadSelect(vInstance)
- Dex.GamepadAddSelectionParent(name: string, vInstance)
- Dex.GamepadAddSelectionTuple(name: string, {vInstance})
- Dex.GamepadRemoveSelectionGroup(name: string, vInstance)
- Dex.GamepadVirtualCursorEnable(vInstance)

Once these are implemented, document them and add a guide for using them and
mapping these to Dex states with proper Unsubscribe handling!
