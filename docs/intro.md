# Introduction

#### Dec is a library for building User Interfaces for Roblox projects. It's easy to write Dec components, small modules of code responsible for specific portions of UI, which can work together to render a full experience or plugin UI at any scale

:::caution
Dec is currently in early development, and a stable first release has not been
finished or tested. DO NOT use Dec in production-bound projects until v1.0.0
is released!
